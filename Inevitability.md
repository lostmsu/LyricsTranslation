Gust of the wind  
And leaf barely yellow detached from parent  
Its slide to the ground began  
Here comes the touch  
Its speed turns to rustling / It stops between others  
And now its last movement begone  


Life wading up  
And dream of each sand grain is still  
The same as was ever before  
To dissipate powe-er,  

But this whole world,  
That banged like a flash in the dark,  
Its winter awaiting ahead  
Goes on aeons passing.  


Now, billions years behind, / that went by  
Like blink,  
Like summer rain, like scarlet sunsets, / We stand  
Under dim lights  
Of the starts, that were far away,  
Tinies that burnt slo-ower than our Sun.  

We helped them as much as we could  
Do it  
Moving the metals closer to the middle  
of the table / Ash lit  
Our path in this/ frozen world  
Ash of the remnants of forgotten stars  


U-up in the sky  
Our last crimson su-un, the only sun that still  
Can feed us but barely so far.  
Its only clear  
That laws of the life are but second, the first are /  
The laws, that govern flow of sand.  

And meanwhile  
We turned into gods ourselves  
In spite of the ancient tell tales  
To limits of humans, But  
Still nothing can  
Be done to reverse age of Space -   
The sand have completed its race  
Deitereum, tritiumâ€¦  

Like stellar wave our life passed through  
The world  
Quiet emergence - quiet fade/The Uni-  
Niverse faded and  
It lost its need in any-y life,  
Limited order in the chaos of whole  

Humans, their term completed, will go  
Away  
Fade after grass and novas, and the last star burning  
Long time since they knew  
That this myth will go:  
Higher predestination awaits.
